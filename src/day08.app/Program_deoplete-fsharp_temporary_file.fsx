(*
Each instruction consists of several parts: the register to modify, whether to increase or decrease that register's value, the amount by which to increase or decrease it, and a condition. If the condition fails, skip the instruction without modifying the register. The registers all start at 0. The instructions look like this:

b inc 5 if a > 1
a inc 1 if b < 5
c dec -10 if a >= 1
c inc -20 if c == 10
These instructions would be processed as follows:

Because a starts at 0, it is not greater than 1, and so b is not modified.
a is increased by 1 (to 1) because b is less than 5 (it is 0).
c is decreased by -10 (to 10) because a is now greater than or equal to 1 (it is 1).
c is increased by -20 (to -10) because c is equal to 10.
After this process, the largest value in any register is 1.
